Quite alright typescript libraries. 

## Http

* [ts-rest](https://ts-rest.com/) - The way to build typesafe http services. Like trpc but in good.

## Schema & Data types
* [zod](https://zod.dev`) - Easy schema validation, though it's missing encoders.
* [remote-data-ts](https://github.com/devexperts/remote-data-ts) - The way to model remote data

## Functional programming
* [effect](https://effect.website/) - Effect system and functional library. 
* [ts-pattern](https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern) - Type-safe pattern matching for TypeScript. Still quite useful although effect's pattern matching will probably take over at some point. 
* [spectacle-ts](https://github.com/anthonyjoeseph/spectacles-ts) - Lens library with autocomplete support.

## Testing
* [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Like (ts-)jest, but working.

## Building & package manager
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - Fast & works
* [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Bundler that actually works.
* [tsx](https://tsx.is/) - Easy runnner for ts projects.
* [tsc-alias](https://github.com/justkey007/tsc-alias) - Makes this ts work somehow.

## React
* [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - The only lib you'll ever need for icons
* [font-source](https://fontsource.org/) - The only lib you'll ever need for fonts.
